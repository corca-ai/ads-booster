# Code Architecture

Status: Active
Last reviewed: 2026-08-31

## Composition

`ads_booster.cli.marketing` exports the sole CLI, `trace-marketing`. `worker run` composes a
`MarketingWorkerLoop` from D1 `WorkerBrokerClient`, SQLite `MarketingInbox`, and
`HostedWorkspaceCaptureExecutor`.

```text
cli/marketing
  -> marketing/worker_loop
     -> marketing/worker_broker       D1 lease, barrier, callback
     -> marketing/inbox               SQLite inbox and outbox
     -> marketing/native_capture      prepare/execute and final validation
        -> marketing/background       background intent/provenance
        -> capture/codex_appium_job   immutable v2 contract
        -> capture/calendar_automation_contract typed EventKit file contract
        -> capture/calendar_preparation post-barrier seed/verify/cleanup
        -> capture/calendar_lifecycle cleanup on every post-prepare exit
        -> capture/appium_codex       one job and native collector
           -> capture/appium_codex_validation paths and completion proof
           -> capture/appium_editor_verifier live UI and process-binding proof
        -> providers/codex_cli        official CLI subprocess
```

## Responsibility boundaries

| Area | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `worker_broker.py` | D1 claim, acknowledgement, barrier, callback HTTP | SQLite/Appium |
| `inbox.py` | ingress, claim, admission, terminal result, callback retry | Cloudflare/Codex |
| `worker_loop.py` | prepare-barrier-execute ordering and ambiguity handling | Trace UI method |
| `background.py` | `background_intent`, allowlisted candidate ranking, digest, provenance | native export |
| `native_capture.py` | hosted payload/context, request paths, native preview PNG validation | UI selectors, image editing |
| `contracts/feedback.py` | strict `trace.feedback-context.v1` shape and canonical digest | rule promotion, review storage |
| `codex_appium_job.py` | v2 context/device/digest/nonce/time/calendar contract | process execution |
| `calendar_automation_contract.py` | typed prepare/cleanup request, result, and event time projection | EventKit execution, layout |
| `calendar_preparation.py` | post-barrier Trace helper launch, Calendar proof and request-owned cleanup | Trace layout, Calendar UI navigation |
| `calendar_lifecycle.py` | independent cleanup budget and primary/cleanup error preservation | EventKit execution |
| `appium_codex.py` | device lock, Calendar lifetime, contract file, one Codex result, native collection | UI reasoning |
| `appium_codex_validation.py` | request paths, result/Ready/Saved consistency, expected titles | process execution |
| `appium_editor_verifier.py` | live editor titles and Trace process launch-binding verification | UI navigation, export rendering |
| `codex_cli.py` | schema-constrained official CLI subprocess, bounded Ready-session recovery, and localhost-only permission profile | custom agent/auth/thread state, image generation |

`CodexAppiumJobContract` uses `trace.codex-appium-job.v2`. Its canonical digest covers identity,
marketing context, prepared background, device, locale/time zone, nonce, and calendar namespace.
The contract is mode 0600 in a mode-0700 request root. Codex runs without user/project configuration;
its commands can access the workspace and loopback Appium, but not home secrets or external hosts.
The worker starts the DEBUG Trace EventKit helper only after execution admission. Its helper launch
adds `-traceMarketingCalendarAutomation`; the final Codex editor keeps the original immutable launch
arguments. Codex reports UI completion and session close only. Worker-owned Calendar proof and
cleanup never enter Ready/Saved/result schemas. Only the worker collector proves the App Group export
and validates the manifest.

Cloudflare owns review-event binding, distinct-candidate rule promotion, override state, task
selection, and callback receipt comparison. Python validates the same feedback envelope, inserts
caption rules into the candidate instruction or carries image correction context in the Appium job,
and returns only the selected digest as its consumption receipt. Neither side changes generated
candidate fields or native artifact fields to transport feedback.

The package deliberately keeps no alternate execution runtime or legacy command compatibility.
`trace-agent` and `trace-ads` are migration-only names.

## Hosted Threads modules

| Module | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `cloudflare/src/threads/client.js` | pinned Graph operations and strict public client surface |
| `transport.js` / `responses.js` | bounded GET retry, no-retry POST, typed Graph parsing |
| `crypto.js` | versioned AES-GCM token encryption |
| `profiles-api.js` / `profiles-store.js` | account-scoped OAuth state, profile lifecycle, default and toggle CAS |
| `media-capability.js` | short-lived HMAC/digest/account/publication-bound private PNG fetch |
| `scheduling.js` | bounded due publication selection and per-row isolation |
| `publication.js` | quota, container, irreversible barrier, publish-once, post-ID readback |
| `engagement.js` | independent metric/reply polling, cursors, reauth/deletion, retention |
| `status-api.js` | public-safe status/metrics plus privileged replies and unknown resolution |

`hosted-workspace.js` owns candidate creation and dual human approval. It snapshots the default
profile at candidate creation and inserts the immutable publication decision in the same D1 batch as
accepted image review. `index.js` composes separate candidate-generation, publication, and engagement
schedulers. None of these modules import or extend Mac worker task kinds or the generic `/v1` adapter.
